Much like the printing press gave access to more information, so we see the potential of AI to empower when control is in our own hands.

## Agents

| ---- | ----------- |
| [learnprompting.org](https://learnprompting.org/) | Very comprehensive free corpus of information on ways to reliably prompt LLMs to get them to do what you want |

## AI Safety/Ethics
This is a loaded subject since there is alot of doomerism and hidden agendas that pass for AI safety. That said, the discussion around security is an immediate concern. Pondering on super-intelligence (I think) is mostly un-interesting and obfuscates the reality of what is actually being built now.

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| AI Safety (Windows on Theory) | A useful introduction to the different branches of concerns in safety and initial conclusions | https://windowsontheory.org/2023/04/12/thoughts-on-ai-safety/ |
