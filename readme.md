Much like the printing press gave access to more information, so we see the potential of AI to empower when control is in our own hands.

## AI Safety/Ethics
This is a loaded subject since there is alot of doomerism and hidden agendas that pass for AI safety. AI Ethics is usually considered from just one moral viewpoint - a sort of liberal bourgeois academic bubble. That said, there are interesting discussions such as immediate security concerns in deploying AI into systems, and the general concern of maintaining a sense of morality in decision making machines.
